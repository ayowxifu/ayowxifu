#  Hi there! Call me Lun :3

I study software engineering in Germany while also working on some own projects using Python and NodeJS.

Aside of that I like to work with Linux and VMs.

Most things on here are somewhat stable and usable as I store private and unstable code on an own GitLab instance

Take a look around if you like! :purple_heart:
